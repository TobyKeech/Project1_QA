## Planning
**Trello Board:**


This was used to identify tasks at three levels to keep track of objects and targets for the day. Three levels of priority were used of low, medium and high to influence the important of features or bug fixes. See example above of this. 

**Stand Ups**
This was consulted on a daily basis with Lyam to access our objectives for the day and any barriers we had. We would consult wether we could provide assiatance for a task the other was attempting to tackle. We provided feedback and suggestions to better improve each others webistes. 

**Inital Steps**
I started by breaking down the example code to help me understand how things worked and the process which were happening. I spent initally before the project week itself reading over how things worked and anything new I broke it down and tried it in a seperate enviroment to better understand. I often took notes and refernced back to these as well as breaking code down line by line. 

## Challanges


## Future Improvements
1. I would like to have added a bookings page to the application as this was thought of late on into the application. Using new react features required more time to understand than I would have liked and by the time I got round to it and wanted to focus on what I had and making it styled well for presentation.
   
2. When changing the property from the status of "SOLD" and "FOR SALE" I would have liked to include a visual change on the application to reflect this. This would have made a more user friendly experience.

3. I feel spending more time with bootstrap would have been benifiical. Although good to use and provided a lot of layouts and structure at times CSS became more challanging due to my lack of knowledge of it and only the second time using it. Certian bugs and issues could have been fixed quicker had I spent more time going over it.  

## What I would do differrently
